overexpress	DecreaseAmount(LGALS1(), GLI1())	6561	Gal-1	4317	Gli-1	In agreement with these published observations, we demonstrated that downregulating Gal-1 reduced SMO and Gli-1 expression, whereas overexpressing Gal-1 increased only Gli-1 expression.
overexpress	IncreaseAmount(AR(mods: (modification)), PHB())	644	AR	8912	PHB	However, another study showed that overexpression of AR in LNCaP cells induced PHB expression, although the induction was less than 2-fold - this may be a consequence of the biphasic response of these cells to increased AR and an attempt to slow down the growth of the cells at very high AR.
overexpress	DecreaseAmount(PTEN(), ARMCX1())	9588	PTEN	18073	Armcx1	Since PTEN deletion alone did not significantly increase Armcx1 levels (XREF_FIG), this mutant is suitable for assessing the effects of overexpressed Armcx1.
