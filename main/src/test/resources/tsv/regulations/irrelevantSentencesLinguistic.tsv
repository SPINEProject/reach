overexpress	DecreaseAmount(STAT2(), STAT1())	11363	STAT2	11362	p-STAT1	Lastly, neutralizing antibody against IFNAR1/2 and knockdown of STAT1 and STAT2 completely suppressed IFITM1, PLSCR1, p-STAT1, and p-STAT2 expression in the resistant cells, thus confirming the involvement of the canonical IFNalpha signaling pathway in driving the overexpression of IFITM1 and other interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) in the resistant cells.
overexpress	IncreaseAmount(ESR1(), VEGFA())	3467	ER	12680	VEGFA	XBP-1-p overexpression improves binding efficiency which is further increased by ER stress thus supporting the idea of dose dependent upregulation of VEGFA transcription under ER stress.
overexpress	IncreaseAmount(PRMT8(mods: (modification)), POU5F1())	5188	PRMT8	9221	Oct4	According to the qPCR and WB results of this research, PRMT8 gene overexpression can lead to up-expression of pluripotent transcription factor OCT4 and Nanog, with higher mRNA and protein level.
overexpress	IncreaseAmount(POU5F1(), VEGFC())	9221	Oct4	12682	VEGF-C	The results showed that Ad5-OCT4-mediated OCT4 overexpression significantly increased the positive levels of VEGF-C and p-VEGFR-3, and decreased the expression level of and E-cadherin, with no significant change in VEGFR-3 expression, XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY OCT4 overexpression promoted the lymphatic metastasis of ECC and affected prognosis.
overexpress	DecreaseAmount(MIR21(mods: (modification)), TP53())	31586	miR-21	11998	p53	As expected, miR-21 overexpression prevented expression of HBP1 and p53 (XREF_FIG A), which subsequently promoted lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells (XREF_FIG B, C).
overexpress	IncreaseAmount(RUNX2(), RUNX2())	10472	core-binding factor subunit alpha-1	10472	Runx2	In fact Smad3 overexpression enhanced the levels of Runx2, also known as core binding factor subunit alpha-1 (CBFalpha-1), Sp7 and Osterix and beta-catenin, which are the master transcription factors for osteocytic differentiation.
overexpress	DecreaseAmount(CTGF(mods: (modification)), NOV())	2500	CTGF	7885	CCN3	We further found that adenoviral overexpression of CCN2 and CTGF suppressed CCN3 and NOV expression, while the overexpression of CCN3 and NOV as well as the suppression of CCN3 and NOV by targeting siRNAs both resulted in enhanced CCN2 and CTGF expression.
overexpress	IncreaseAmount(SPAG9(), MMP9())	14524	SPAG9	7176	MMP-9	In U87cells, knockdown of SPAG9 markedly decreased cell invasion and MMP-9 expression, which was completely restored by overexpression of PODXL.
overexpress	DecreaseAmount(MIR21(mods: (modification)), PDCD4())	31586	miR-21	8763	Pdcd4	We found that overexpression of miR-21 could significantly reduce the expression of both Tipe2 and Pdcd4 mRNA.
OE	IncreaseAmount(NPY(), NPY())	7955	NPY	7955	NPY	We have constructed an NPY transgenic mouse model (OE-NPY (DBH) mouse), where targeted overexpression leads to increased levels of NPY in noradrenergic and adrenergic neurons.
inhibitor of	DecreaseAmount(RHOA(), SRF())	667	RhoA	11291	SRF	Using this approach, we identified CCG-1423 as a potent inhibitor of RhoA stimulated MRTF and SRF gene transcription 15.
inhibitor of	IncreaseAmount(YAP1(), EGFR())	16262	YAP1	3236	EGFR	A pharmacological inhibitor of YAP1 signaling, verteporfin also synergized with cisplatin, radiation and erlotinib in NSCLC cells by potentiating cisplatin and radiation related double stranded breaks and decreasing expression of YAP1 and EGFR.
