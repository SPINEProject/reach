KO	IncreaseAmount(BAAT(), NUCB2())	932	BAT	8044	NEFA	Our data demonstrate that despite enhanced lipolysis in TRIP-Br2 KO mice, coordinate up-regulation of fatty acid oxidation and thermogenesis in both WAT and BAT lead to enhanced in situ fatty acid utilization as well as the absence of increased circulating NEFA levels and ectopic fat accumulation in metabolic organs such as liver - a finding that is clearly observed in WT mice fed with HFD.
KO	IncreaseAmount(IRF1(mods: (modification)), IFNB1())	6116	IRF1	5434	IFN-beta	Thus, the decreased IRF1 level in Def6 KO cells contributes to the lower IFN-beta expression, and also indicates that Def6 regulates Ifnb1 transcription at least in part via modulation of IRF1 nuclear expression level.
KO	IncreaseAmount(CD28(), CD69())	1653	CD28	1694	CD69	Similarly, rapamycin treatment could not restore early activation of TSC1KO T cells, although CD28 co-stimulation can slightly increase CD25 and CD69 expression (XREF_FIG).

dominant negative	IncreaseAmount(GLI1(), TBK1())	4317	GLI1	11584	TBK1	Consistent with this idea, we found that inhibition of GLI transcriptional activity by either the dominant negative Gli3T repressor, or shRNA mediated knockdown of GLI1 in Panc-1 cells decreased IKBKE but not TBK1 mRNA levels (XREF_FIG), suggesting that TBK1 does not act downstream of GLI1.
dominant negative	DecreaseAmount(PAX7(mods: (modification)), MYOD1())	8621	Pax7	7611	MyoD	However, expression of Pax3 or Pax7 dominant negative constructs inhibits expression of Myf5, MyoD and myogenin, and prevents differentiation from proceeding.

overexpress	IncreaseAmount(OR3A4P(mods: (modification)), NTN4())	15510	OR3A4	13658	NTN4	Therefore, OR3A4 overexpression may promote growth, invasion, metastasis, and tumorigenesis in gastric cancer in vitro and in vivo by upregulating MACC1 and GNB2L1 expression, and downregulating PDLIM2 and NTN4 expression.
overexpress	DecreaseAmount(NTRK2(mods: (modification)), FMR1())	8032	TrkB	3775	Fmr1	There is also evidence that BDNF is upstream of FMRP activity : BDNF, but not neurotrophin-3 application, and overexpression of TrkB was shown to slightly reduce the expression of the Fmr1 gene, implicating BDNF-TrkB signaling in the negative regulation of FMRP levels [XREF_BIBR]; BDNF also caused dissociation of the FMRP translational repression complex, allowing translation to occur specifically in dendritic compartments [XREF_BIBR].
overexpress	IncreaseAmount(BCL6(mods: (modification)), CXCR4())	1001	BCL6	2561	CXCR4	Lastly, in line with the ability of IL-6 to promote changes in CD4 + T cells consistent with T FH cells, (i.e. enhanced IL-21 production and expression of BCL6), we also observed that overexpression of BCL6 itself increased expression of the T FH -associated markers CXCR5 and CXCR4.
overexpress	DecreaseAmount(MAP4K1(mods: (modification)), CDKN1A())	6863	HPK1	1784	p21	While investigating the negative regulatory role of HPK1 in cell cycle distribution, we found that HPK1 overexpression and activation led to increased protein expression of both p21 and p27 in c1 and c2 clones compared with the parental Panc-1 cells after treatment with 0.5 micromol/L MG132 for 48 hours (XREF_FIG).
overexpress	DecreaseAmount(TP53(mods: (modification)), MAD2L1())	11998	p53	6763	Mad2	Interestingly, loss of p53 or its effector p21 results in overexpression of Mad2.

overexpress	DecreaseAmount(PER2(mods: (modification)), IRF9())	8846	PER2	6131	IRF9	Although exogenous PER2 overexpression reduced the apparently coherent elevated levels of Mx1 and IRF9 in OR6 replicating the HCV RNA, we assume that some viral components act to modulate viral load by means of the activation or inhibition of host defense proteins in order to maintain low steady levels of virus in the infected cells, enabling HCV to escape from the host immune surveillance, and facilitating persistent viral infection.
overexpress	DecreaseAmount(TFAP2A(mods: (modification)), BCL2())	11742	AP-2alpha	990	Bcl-2	Furthermore, overexpression of AP-2alpha increased Bax expression and decreased Bcl-2 expression, whereas down-regulation of AP-2alpha expression resulted in a decrease in Bax expression and an increase in Bcl-2 expression.
