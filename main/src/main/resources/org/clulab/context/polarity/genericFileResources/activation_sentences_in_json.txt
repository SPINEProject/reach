Epidermal growth factor (EGF), transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mediate cellular proliferation, regulate differentiation, and stimulate vasculogenesis and angiogenesis, respectively [XREF_BIBR].
Meanwhile, covalently tethered EGF has been shown to alter ERK phosphorylation levels and promote increased survival and osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) relative to conditions that received soluble EGF [XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR].
In our previous reports, we found that EGF can promote the differentiation of fetal bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells XREF_BIBR and fetal pancreatic stem cells XREF_BIBR into islet cells.
In particular, the Delta and Notch like epidermal growth factor related receptor (DNER) can be induced by histone deacetylase inhibition to inhibit the growth of and induce the differentiation of Glioblastoma neurospheres and xenografts [XREF_BIBR].
Implantation of EGF pellets supports normal mammary gland differentiation in ovariectomized mice, as demonstrated by the development of terminal end buds XREF_BIBR.
EGF increase may potentially be triggering autocrine effects on BJ cells as well as paracrine effects on keratinocytes, by modulating epidermal proliferation and differentiation [XREF_BIBR], also emphasising the importance of the EGF effect in the wound closure of wound healing [XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR].
