It has been proposed that EGF prevents BMP mediated keratinocyte differentiation through inhibiting BMP signalling.
In the rodent SVZ, EGF prevents C cell differentiation and encourages infiltrative behavior similar to that seen in high-grade gliomas.
Megf10, a novel multiple epidermal growth factor repeat transmembrane protein that impinges on Notch signaling stimulates myoblast proliferation and inhibits differentiation.
EGF stimulates proliferation and inhibits differentiation in thyroid cells by activation of MEK and ERK.
15 Pref-1 is a member of the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like protein family that is highly expressed by adipocyte precursor cells and inhibits adipocyte and osteoblast differentiation.
However, the inclusion of EGF in the lactogenic hormone mix blocks differentiation.
We found that tethered EGF, but not soluble EGF, increased the numbers of colonies formed regardless of adhesion background, and that tethered EGF did not impair early stages of osteogenic differentiation.
This study demonstrates that even low concentrations of EGF and bFGF may limit the differentiation ability of stem cells during stem cell expansion in vitro.
However, the inclusion of EGF, other mitogenic growth factors or expression of transforming oncogenes in HC11 cells blocks lactogenic differentiation.
EGF and bFGF added to medium promoted neural lineage differentiation and impaired the mesodermal differentiation ability of ASCs.
