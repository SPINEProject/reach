Beyond the well-recognized problem of hearing impairment, increasing attention is being paid to the cumulative adverse effects of noise exposure on extra-auditory systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In a more than 10-year prospective epidemiological study conducted by Sorensen et al. in a Danish cohort, each 10-dB increase in average road traffic noise at the current residence was found to be associated with a statistically significant 11% increased risk of incident diabetes; this risk increased to 14% when road traffic noise was estimated for all the places in which an individual had lived during the previous 5&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Their study raised concern about noise as a risk factor of diabetes, particularly given the global epidemic of this disease and the increasingly widespread pattern of noise pollution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. A previous study by our group indicated that noise exposure at a 95-dB sound pressure level (dB SPL) induces insulin resistance in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. More recently, another experimental study reported abnormalities in glucose regulation and insulin sensitivity in rats that were chronically exposed to noise at a 100-dB SPL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Because insulin resistance is well known to be a key contributor to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and a key pathological feature of T2DM, these experimental studies together suggested a contributory role of noise exposure to increasing the risk of T2DM. Considering the alarming global epidemic of T2DM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and the global prevalence of noise pollution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], it is imperative to explore the mechanisms underlying the impairment of insulin sensitivity after noise exposure.</p><p id="Par23">We previously examined circulatory corticosterone levels in mice subjected to noise exposure at a 95-dB SPL at 4&#x000a0;h/day for 1, 10, and 20&#x000a0;days. The collected data showed that at 1&#x000a0;day after the cessation of noise exposure, the levels of plasma corticosterone in all three noise groups were significantly increased compared to those in matched control groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. This result was consistent with other reports indicating that noise is a source of environmental stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Furthermore, these data illustrated a sustained stress response to chronic noise and support the notion that the animals did not adapt to the noise, even after prolonged exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par24">Persistently elevated cortisol levels have been proposed to be associated with the development of insulin resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Positive associations between excess stress hormones, oxidative stress, and insulin resistance have been widely reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. It is also well documented that the release of inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; (TNF-&#x003b1;) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), which are often cited as crucial cytokines that mediate insulin resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], can be induced by chronic stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The protein c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) has been increasingly recognized as an important mediator of insulin resistance that is associated with inflammation and oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] through the phosphorylation of serine residues in insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Considering these facts, we postulated that the adverse effects of noise exposure on insulin sensitivity might be mediated, at least in part, through complex interactions between inflammation, oxidative stress, and the JNK/IRS1 pathway. Thus, in the present study, we evaluated the influence of noise exposure (95&#x000a0;dB SPL, 4&#x000a0;h/day for 1, 10, or 20 consecutive days) on systemic insulin sensitivity, the JNK/IRS1/Akt pathway, and markers of inflammation and oxidative stress in ICR mice.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Animals and experimental protocol</title><p id="Par25">Five-week-old wild-type male ICR mice were obtained from the Qinglongshan Animal Center (Nanjing, China, SCXK(SU)2012-0008). In total, 144 mice were used in this study. The mice were housed in conventional cages with a 12-h light/dark cycle (lights on at 7&#x000a0;am) and had free access to food (standard rodent chow, SHOOBREE, Xietong Organism, Jiangsu, China) and water. After a 1-week acclimation period, the animals were randomly assigned into one control group or into one of three noise-exposure groups. The animals in the noise-exposure groups were exposed to broadband noise at a 95-dB SPL for 4&#x000a0;h/day between 8:00&#x000a0;am and 12:00&#x000a0;pm for 1&#x000a0;day (the N1D group), 10&#x000a0;days (the N10D group), or 20&#x000a0;days (the N20D group). The animals in each of the noise-exposure groups were further subdivided into three subgroups according to the times at which the assessments were performed: at 1&#x000a0;day, 1&#x000a0;week, or 1&#x000a0;month after the final noise exposure (1DPN, 1WPN, and 1MPN, respectively) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The mice in the control group were also subdivided into the same subgroups according to the assessment time points and served as age-matched controls. The animals were treated humanely and with regard for the alleviation of suffering. Food consumption per cage was measured every 3 or 4&#x000a0;days by subtracting the amount of the food left from the initial amount of food supplied. To avoid circadian rhythm-induced variations, the insulin tolerance test (ITT) was always initiated at 9:00&#x000a0;am, and tissue and blood samples used for further studies were collected between 2:00&#x000a0;pm and 3:00&#x000a0;pm.

Electrical Gaussian noise generated by a System III processor from Tucker-Davis-Technologies (TDT, Alachua, FL, USA) was delivered to speakers after power amplification.

The recommended exposure limit in workplaces according to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is 90&#x000a0;dBA for 8&#x000a0;h. Therefore, the exposure setting used in this study is not higher than the occupational safety allowance. Similar to our previous observations, the blunted glucose response observed during the ITT was shown in all noise-exposed groups at 1DPN and was also evident at 1WPN in the N10D and N20D groups in this study, indicating a trend towards insulin resistance with prolonged noise exposure.</p><p id="Par36">Skeletal muscles are the most important insulin-targeted tissue involved in maintaining whole-body glucose homeostasis under insulin-stimulated conditions and are major sites of insulin resistance in T2DM subjects. In skeletal muscle, insulin binds to a surface receptor and triggers a cascade of signaling events involving IRS-1 and Akt that induces the translocation of the glucose transporter from its intracellular depot(s) to the cell surface, where these transport proteins mediate the uptake of glucose into the cell. Defects in these signaling pathways are considered the major pathogenic disturbances underlying the development and progression of insulin resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Decreased Akt phosphorylation at the insulin-responsive active site (Ser<sup>473</sup> and Thr<sup>308</sup>) following insulin stimulation have been well documented in insulin resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In the present study, noise-exposed animals exhibited a blunted glucose response to insulin injection, which was accompanied by decreased Akt phosphorylation in the skeletal muscle, indicating an impairment of skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity.</p><p id="Par37">Noise has long been classified as an environmental stress. Several studies (including the two studies illustrating the development of insulin resistance in animals subjected to chronic noise) have reported significant increases in plasma stress hormone levels during and after various noises [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In our previous study, increased plasma corticosterone levels were observed at 1&#x000a0;day after noise exposure for 1, 10, and 20&#x000a0;days, suggesting a sustained stress response throughout the noise exposure in the N20D group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Persistently elevated cortisol levels have been proposed to be an etiological factor of insulin resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Therefore, we have proposed that stress responses might contribute to the development of insulin resistance in noise-exposed animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) is an evolutionarily conserved stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) that is activated primarily by inflammatory cytokines and exposure to environmental stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Recent studies have identified JNK as a crucial link between environmental challenges and metabolic regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Activated JNK can phosphorylate IRS-1 at the inhibitory site Ser<sup>307</sup> and therefore suppress insulin signal transduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The results of the present study indicated that systemic insulin resistance in the noise-exposed groups was accompanied by an increased activation of JNK with a corresponding increase in IRS-1 Ser<sup>307</sup> phosphorylation in skeletal muscle tissue. Although our data do not allow us to rule out the contribution of other cellular serine kinases to the altered phosphorylation state of muscle IRS-1, it is highly plausible that JNK might serve as a candidate for the link between noise exposure and insulin resistance.</p><p id="Par38">Accumulating evidence supports the notion that inflammatory markers can be induced after various stresses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-6, are thought to contribute to the development of insulin resistance through the activation of several stress kinases, such as JNK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. As noise has long been realized as an environmental stress, we wondered whether inflammation might be involved in the adverse effect of noise exposure on insulin sensitivity. The data collected in this study show that the plasma concentrations of both TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-6 were comparable between the N1D and control group at both 1DPN and 1WPN, indicating that no inflammatory response was caused by the 1-day noise exposure. These inflammatory cytokines were significantly increased in the N20D group at 1DPN but not at 1WPN, suggesting that a temporary inflammatory response occurred in the animals that were subjected to chronic noise exposure. The recovery of inflammatory cytokine levels occurred earlier than that of insulin sensitivity, indicated by the same-as-control blood concentrations of TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-6 and the significantly blunted glucose response during ITT at 1WPN. The time courses of the inflammatory response, JNK activation, and the impaired insulin sensitivity in the N20D group suggest that the inflammation might be an event that links noise exposure with insulin resistance rather than a consequence of abnormal insulin sensitivity. Thus, consistent with the findings of Cui et al. in rat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], our results provide more evidence that inflammation might contribute to the increased diabetes risk after chronic noise exposure.</p><p id="Par39">Oxidative stress, defined as a disturbance in the balance between the production of reactive oxygen species and antioxidant defenses, has been proposed as a contributor to both the onset and the progression of insulin resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. As one of the major secondary oxidation products, MDA level has been regarded as reflecting the level of tissue damage caused by oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In the present work, the N20D group exhibited significant increases in MDA levels in skeletal muscles at both 1DPN and 1WPN, indicating enhanced oxidative stress. SOD and CAT are powerful endogenous enzymatic antioxidants that are responsible for protecting cells from oxidative damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In the present work, no differences in SOD activity were shown, whereas significant increases in CAT activity in skeletal muscle were exhibited in the N20D group at both 1DPN and 1WPN, suggesting an insufficient compensatory response to oxidative stress. Although the cross-sectional design of the present study does not permit us to determine the exact relationship between the insulin resistance, inflammatory cytokine levels and oxidative stress exhibited in the N20D group at both 1DPN and 1WPN, these data provide some information regarding the possible molecular mechanism underlying the non-auditory effects of noise pollution.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par40">We observed that insulin sensitivity impairment in noise-exposed animals was accompanied by an increase in JNK activation with a corresponding increase in IRS-1 serine phosphorylation in skeletal muscle tissue. Consistent with the possible causal role of inflammation and oxidative stress in JNK activation, we observed that the levels of circulatory inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress markers in skeletal muscle were increased in animals that were exposed to noise for 20&#x000a0;days. These results suggest that the JNK/IRS pathway might mediate the adverse effect of noise exposure on skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity and that inflammatory response and oxidative stress are involved in the onset and/or development of insulin resistance after chronic noise exposure. Additional and more comprehensive methods (e.g., inhibiting JNK activity using JNK inhibitors) are required to reveal the exact relationships between these factors and their individual contributions to insulin resistance after noise exposure. The influence of noise exposure on the insulin sensitivity of liver and adipose tissue, the other two main types of insulin-sensitive tissues, should also be further investigated in future studies.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>1DPN</term><def><p id="Par5">1-day post-noise exposure</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>1MPN</term><def><p id="Par6">1-month post-noise exposure</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>1WPN</term><def><p id="Par7">1-week post-noise exposure</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Akt</term><def><p id="Par8">Protein kinase B</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AUC</term><def><p id="Par9">Area under the curve</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CAT</term><def><p id="Par10">Catalase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>dB SPL</term><def><p id="Par11">Decibel sound pressure level</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IL-6</term><def><p id="Par12">Interleukin-6</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IRS-1</term><def><p id="Par13">Insulin receptor substrate-1</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ITT</term><def><p id="Par14">Insulin tolerance test</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>JNK</term><def><p id="Par15">c-Jun N-terminal kinase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MDA</term><def><p id="Par16">Malondialdehyde</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>N10D</term><def><p id="Par17">Noise exposure for 10&#x000a0;days</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>N1D</term><def><p id="Par18">Noise exposure for 1&#x000a0;day</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>N20D</term><def><p id="Par19">Noise exposure for 20&#x000a0;days</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SOD</term><def><p id="Par20">Superoxide dismutase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TNF-&#x003b1;</term><def><p id="Par21">Tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1;</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Thanks to Prof. Jian Wang for the writing assistance of the manuscript.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par41">This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (81670935, 81520108015, 81100548, and 81271086) and the Fundamental Research Fund of Southeast University (2242016K40073).</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p id="Par42">Please contact the author for data requests.</p></sec></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>LL and CF designed the experiments.
